Build instructions:

gcc version 3 is required.
python development environment is required.
java development environment is required.

1) Make sure all the "salsa" modules are checked out.  "cvs checkout
salsa" should do this.
OR
Unpack files from ResolutionServer-xxx.tar.gz distribution.

2) Install Charm (charm.cs.uiuc.edu) : after building "charm++", build the
"liveViz" and the "pythonCCS" modules:
cd tmp/libs/ck-libs/liveViz; make

A link to the include files for your Python developement is required
before building pythonCCS.  For example on Fedora Core 4 you would
need to type the following:

cd tmp/libs/ck-libs/pythonCCS; ln -s /usr/include/python2.4 ./python; make

Set the CHARM_DIR environment variable to point at the source directory
for Charm.

3) "cd ../InteractiveClient; make" to compile the Java client.

4) If your linux distribution does not have boost installed, unpack (but no
need to build) boost (www.boost.org) in the parent directory.

    wget http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/boost/boost_1_33_0.tar.gz

5) Install and build the Apache Xerces C++ XML Parser (xml.apache.org) in
the parent directory.  Set the XERCESCROOT environment variable to point
at this directory.

    wget ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/apache/xml/xerces-c/source/xerces-c-src_2_7_0.tar.gz
    export XERCESCROOT=<full path to xerces-c-src2_7_0>
    cd $XERCESCROOT/src/xercesc
    autoconf
    runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nsocket -tnative -rpthread
    gmake

6) Type "configure". Type "make"

To run:

"Run_Salsa.sh" will run a demonstration on the localhost

See "run_server.sh" for an example command line for the server.  Note that
the server can be run on a remote host.

To start the client, use "java -jar ../InteractiveClient/Salsa.jar
HOSTNAME PORT_NUMBER" where these are printed out by the server.

--------------------
ISSUES:

There seems to be a bug in gcc version 4.0 and later that causes problems
with the image display.  The upshot is that only z-axis view are displayed
correctly.
