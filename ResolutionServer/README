Build instructions:

Make sure all the "salsa" modules are checked out.

Install Charm (charm.cs.uiuc.edu) : after building "charm++", build the
"liveViz" and the "pythonCCS" modules:
cd src/libs/ck-libs/liveViz; make
cd src/libs/ck-libs/pythonCCS; make

Set the CHARM_DIR environment variable to point at the source directory
for Charm.

"cd ../InteractiveClient; make" to compile the Java client.

Unpack (but no need to build) boost (www.boost.org) in the parent
directory.

Install and build the Apache Xerces C++ XML Parser (xml.apache.org) in
the parent directory.  Set the XERCESROOT environment variable to point
at this directory.
