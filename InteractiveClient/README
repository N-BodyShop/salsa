Set the environment variable "CHARM_DIR" to point to the directory where
the source of Charm++ is installed.  A recent version of Charm++ will be
needed since this package is developed in concert with the Charm
developers.

Type: "make".

See the "ResolutionServer" module to build and run a server to connect
to.
